This the feature list for my Capstone Project 


3 main features:
1. The stock Questions 
2. The Stock Suggestion 
3. The Wishlist 


The Stock Questions
* The questions will be displayed in a predetermined format
* The answers will be displayed in the form of checkboxes 


The Logic:
* Each answer will be assigned a value of points that will be tracked by certain personality categories 
   * As of right now, some of them include:

1. The Hypebeast: Agressive ---> TESLA
 - In your mind, the world is yours to take and "volatility" is your middle name so it's only right that your company is as aggresive as you are. You probably wouldn't mind being decked out in Supreme or any other luxury brand with a huge logo. 

2. The Vicenarian: Moderate - Aggressive  ---> APPLE
 - You grew up in that weird space of time where videogames were popular but so was going outside. You've grown up in a world filled that was always on the cutting-edge of technology so it's only right that your stock reflects that.

3. The Millennial: Moderate ---> STARBUCKS
- The classic millenial: cold-brew coffee, avocado toast and living on your own terms. However, you're getting up there age so it's only right that you invest in the last thing you hold "near-and-dear".

4. The Commoner: Moderate - Conservative ---> JOHNSON & JOHNSON
- You're not "common" by any means but you may feel like life is starting to slow down; giving you time to realy enjoy it. You need a stock that is strong now but still has plenty of room for growth; just like you.

5. The Boomer: Conservative ---> 3M
- You feel like life is on cruise control right now and nothing can get you down. You may have more "traditional" views so you should invest in a company that also a long history of good results.


The Stock Suggestion 
* This spot in the app will show you what stock you are mostly to buy based off of your personality 


The Logic:
* The personality categories are variables that are tracking the amount of points they are receiving based off of the users’ selections
* This is where the API call will come in
   * There will be conditional logic that will check to see which category has the most points
   * There will be an api response that will then be run that grab either a stock from a certain sector or a pre-called list of stocks **Haven’t decided yet 
* It will then display a couple things:
1. The Ticker symbol 
2. The full name of the stock
3. A creative description about what we think their personality type is 
4. More statistics about the stock that was picked like:
   1.  current closing price, dividend yield, market cap, etc.
* You will then have the option to either:
1. Restart the program and try again
2. Add the stock to a wishlist for later 
3. Buy the stock 
* this would send you to a custom page full of referral links and partners where the user could buy the stock

**BIG OPTIONAL TICKET**
* Find a way to get them to play multiple times


Diversify
* Prompt the user to play again but maybe pretend to be someone else like a family member or a close friend 
* This would allow them to get different outcomes which would in turn help diversify their portfolio

The Wishlist / The Portfolio (Maybe)
* This page of the app shows a list of stocks that are on your wishlist 
* Here the have the option to:
1. Remove the stock from the list
2. Buy the stock which sends them to the same landing page with affiliates links
3. Learn more about the stock if the information provided wasn’t satisfactory 
   1. This would sent to a stats site like NASDAQ or Seeking Alpha
* This may be a cool option if you play the game multiple times to see what you get 
   * This works if the category selections have multiple stocks in them


The Logic 
* This page will take the ticker symbol and full company name from the suggestion page and place it in the numbered slots 
   * The numbered slots would appear as stocks are added to the list
   * The buttons for additional actions will display as well and be functional (their uses are stated above)
* The final button will take you back to the landing page to play again
